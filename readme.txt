PokéBoutsVGC
The goal of the PokéBoutsVGC project is to create a game that simulates a Pokémon battle in the classic Red, Blue, and Yellow games. In a simple single battle, one Pokémon is on the field at a time, and each player has 6 Pokémon on their team. The opponent will be a randomly generated team of six that chooses random moves, while the player will be able to choose and customize their own team before going into battle.
