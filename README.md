# PokéBoutsVGC

The goal of the PokéBoutsVGC project is to create a game that simulates a Pokémon battle in the classic Red, Blue, and Yellow games. In a simple single battle, one Pokémon is on the field at a time, and each player has 6 Pokémon on their team. The opponent will be a randomly generated team of six that chooses random moves, while the player will be able to choose and customize their own team before going into battle.

### Run Instructions
First, download files and import into IDE, ensuring Python is installed. The user should make sure to download the pickle, requests, cmu_graphics, and bs4 modules and ensure they work with current version of Python. Do this by opening a terminal in the code editor or terminal application in the laptop, and running pip install [module name]. Then run test.py to make sure the csv files are properly updated before running main.py to start the game.

### Shortcut Commands
'tab' in battle to restart
